This can be seen in the steps used above to\n        calculate the routing table, and in the definition of the\n        routing table structure.\n        Each one of the multiple routes will be of the same type\n        (intra-area, inter-area, type 1 external or type 2 external),\n        cost, and will have the same associated area.  However, each\n        route may specify a separate next hop and Advertising router.\n        There is no requirement that a router running OSPF keep track of\n        all possible equal-cost routes to a destination.  An\n        implementation may choose to keep only a fixed number of routes\n        to any given destination.  This does not affect any of the\n        algorithms presented in this specification.\nMoy                         Standards Track                   [Page 178]\nRFC 2328                     OSPF Version 2                   April 1998\nFootnotes\n    [1]The graph'",
